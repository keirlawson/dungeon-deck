# Dungeon Deck

Turn your Stream Deck (or Mini/XL) into a headless sound/automation board. It
supports displaying images on the respective buttons, playing sounds as well as
interacting with home automations via MQTT.

## Usage

```sh
dungeon-deck
```

### Run at startup

In order to run this application headless on the likes of a
[Pi Zero 2 W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/)
SystemD can be utilised. First in order to ensure that the PuseAudio service is
running even without a user logging in we need to enable "lingering" for that
user, which should cause associated SystemD services to start running at boot:

```sh
loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

We can then use our own service to control starting up, example of this
approach, along with a service to connect to a bluetooth speaker on boot can be
found in the [examples directory](./examples/). These service files should be
placed in `~/.config/systemd/user/` and enabled as so:

```sh
systemctl --user enable btconnect.service
systemctl --user enable dungeondeck.service
```

## Configuration

Dungeon Deck reads in configuration for a `dungeon.toml` file located in its
working directory. Example configuration:

```toml
device = "RevisedMini"

[mqtt]
host = "mymqtthost"
user = "someusername"
pass = "somepassword"

[buttons]

[buttons.first.one]
image = "./swords.png"
sound = "./epicbattle.mp3"
repeat = true

[buttons.second.three]
playlist = "./songs.m3u"

[buttons.third.five]
text-size = 10.0
text = "press me"
topic = "some/topic"
payload = "pressed"
```

Possible `device` values are:

- `Original`
- `OriginalV2`
- `Mk2`
- `Mini`
- `RevisedMini`
- `XL`
